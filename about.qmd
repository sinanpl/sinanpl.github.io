Welcome to my corner of the digital world!

I'm Sinan, and I'm passionate about leveraging the power of 
machine learning to help organizations achieve their goals.

I have a solid foundation of applied machine learning
from a statistical learning perspective, mainly focused
on tabular data. More recently, I've become more interested and experienced
in productionizing machine learning products and NLP.

Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid soccer fan, cinema enthusiast and keen reader. 
But my deepest passion is rooted in music and finding inspiration in the melodies of the
[baÄŸlama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Flama) 
and [ney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ney). 

I'm always keen to connect and exchange ideas, so [let's get in touch](https://linkedin.com/in/SinanPolatoglu)!
