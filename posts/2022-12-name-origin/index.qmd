This is an excerpt from a mail I received from the Belgian cinema chain 
Kinepolis this week. I have never been to a Turkish movie at Kinepolis nor indicated such preference in my account, yet, Kinepolis correctly **inferred the origin of my name** being Turkish. 

I was quite amused with this. Mostly because of this anecdote confirming
my belief that a **surname gives away quite some information** on one's **cultural origin**.
Did you know that [Ludwig *van* Beethoven's roots lie in Mechelen, Belgium](https://focusonbelgium.be/en/facts/did-you-know-ludwig-van-beethovens-roots-lie-mechelen)?


### The study of names

The study of individual's names is referred to as *anthroponymy*. 
Activities within this field include classifying names with regards to gender and ethnicity to even tracing historical information.

Before the availability of contemporary NLP techniques, classification was mostly limited to database retrieval of known assocations between names and attributes.

More recently, researchers started to used machine learning models that learn **assocations** between **character patterns** in names and attributes such as gender, ethnicity etc.

I think two simple aspects give tells on the origin of a name: unique characters and common affixes.

#### Unique characters

In first place, the occurrence of characters unique to a region is a big tell on the origin of a name. As the figure below illustrates, alphabets differ by region. And even when the same alphabet is used, sometimes there are minor differences in the presence of specific characters.

If one would wonder the cultural origin of **حكيم زياش** (*Hakim Ziyech*), the Arabic characters significantly narrow the possible options. The similar holds for **Weiß**, as the ß (*Eszett*) is unique to the German language.

This is quite obvious, but not very informative for the majority of names.


#### Common affixes

More relevant are the frequently occurring affixes in surnames. Sometimes, surnames have prefixes / suffixes that point towards a language / region. This list of [common name affixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_family_name_affixes) is longer than you might imagine.

Simply, 'son of' already has >40 matches that characterise a language/region. A few examples, all denoting "son of":

- Ben * (Arabic, Hebrew)
- De * (Italian)
- *dze (Georgian)
- *escu (Romanian)
- *ian (Armenian, Persian)
- *ūnas (Lithuanian)
- *oğlu (Turkish)

Given the last example, you now know how Kinepolis got it right! :)

### Name checker services

There exist services that bring name information to your fingertips. **Namsor** is such an example, try it out [here](https://namsor.app/) - maybe even [using R](https://github.com/SinanPolatoglu/namsor).
