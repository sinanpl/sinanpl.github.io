Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, recently published an update of open data on birthdays in Belgium.
I took the time to explore the data a bit. It reminded me of this neat
[dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bo.mccready8742/viz/TheMostCommonBirthdaysintheUnitedStates/CommonBirthdays)
I drew some inspiration from. 

Compared to the US birthdays, the Belgian data is more granular and provides more opportunities to 
retrieve some insights in **birth patterns**. It is surprising how 
giving birth is **less random** than would one would initially assume.

Most importantly, I observed: 

- Effect of weekday: giving birth during weekend is far less common than giving birth on a weekday.
- Effect of seasons: people reproduce more frequently between October - December. As a consequence, more people are born between August - September. 

Have a look at the storyboard I created below. I start with how the time 
series data look like and explore some insights with more adequate visualizations.
