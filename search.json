    "section": "",
    "text": "Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in analytics, often taught early in educational programs. However, in organizational settings it is crucial not to rely solely on p-values for drawing inferences.\n\nSignificance Testing in a Nutshell\nSignificance testing can be summarized in the following steps:\n\nFormulate a ‘null hypothesis’: Define the expected values for the test statistic, assuming that there is no effect.\nEvaluate the extent to which the observed sample statistic deviates from the expected values. If the deviation is substantial, the null hypothesis will be rejected.\nThe decision to accept or reject the null hypothesis also depends on the chosen significance level, which represents the willingness to accept the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\n\nChallenges in Organizational Contexts\nHypothesis testing offers valuable insights, but its utility may diminish under certain conditions. Particularly in organizational contexts, possessing complete organizational data or a large sample makes inference based on p-values less appropriate.\n\nComplete Organizational Data\nConsider a scenario where you want to test if the average age in your organization deviates from an industry benchmark. Assuming you have the ages of all employees within your organization, you essentially have the entire population of interest, which removes the need for hypothesis testing and estimation. P-values lose their relevance as uncertainty is eliminated, allowing for direct calculation of precise population parameters. This ensures accurate conclusions and decision-making without the inherent limitations of p-values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge samples\nP-values are sensitive to sample size. Large samples may yield statistically significant results even when the effect size is negligible and practically insignificant. Consequently, relying exclusively on p-values in such cases could lead to misleading conclusions and unwarranted actions, while overlooking the practical relevance and actual impact of the observed effect.\n\n\n\nSolution: Incorporate Effect Sizes\nEffect sizes offer valuable insights into the practical importance of findings by quantifying the magnitude of relationships. Including effect sizes alongside p-values in analyses enables more meaningful interpretations, ensuring that statistically significant results are also assessed for their real-world impact. This promotes informed decision-making and better-targeted interventions.\nExamples of effect sizes include:\n\nCohen’s d: Quantifies the difference between two group means, typically used in t-tests.\nCorrelation coefficient: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two numeric variables.\nEta-squared (η²): Measures the proportion of total variance in the dependent variable attributable to the effect of one of the independent variables.\n\n\nThe above covers some key ideas of a post I collaborated on with my colleague Maarten. Check out this post which discusses how it applies to rewards analytics and the pay gap."

    "text": "Hi Sinan,\nThis month we bring the most inspiring productions from Turkish cinema.\n…\nYakında görüşürüz\nThe Kinepolis Team\n\nThis is an excerpt from a mail I received from the Belgian cinema chain Kinepolis this week. I have never been to a Turkish movie at Kinepolis nor indicated such preference in my account, yet, Kinepolis correctly inferred the origin of my name being Turkish.\nI was quite amused with this. Mostly because of this anecdote confirming my belief that a surname gives away quite some information on one’s cultural origin. Did you know that Ludwig van Beethoven’s roots lie in Mechelen, Belgium?\n\nThe study of names\nThe study of individual’s names is referred to as anthroponymy. Activities within this field include classifying names with regards to gender and ethnicity to even tracing historical information.\nBefore the availability of contemporary NLP techniques, classification was mostly limited to database retrieval of known assocations between names and attributes.\nMore recently, researchers started to used machine learning models that learn assocations between character patterns in names and attributes such as gender, ethnicity etc.\nI think two simple aspects give tells on the origin of a name: unique characters and common affixes.\n\nUnique characters\nIn first place, the occurrence of characters unique to a region is a big tell on the origin of a name. As the figure below illustrates, alphabets differ by region. And even when the same alphabet is used, sometimes there are minor differences in the presence of specific characters.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one would wonder the cultural origin of حكيم زياش (Hakim Ziyech), the Arabic characters significantly narrow the possible options. The similar holds for Weiß, as the ß (Eszett) is unique to the German language.\nThis is quite obvious, but not very informative for the majority of names.\n\n\nCommon affixes\nMore relevant are the frequently occurring affixes in surnames. Sometimes, surnames have prefixes / suffixes that point towards a language / region. This list of common name affixes is longer than you might imagine.\nSimply, ‘son of’ already has &gt;40 matches that characterise a language/region. A few examples, all denoting “son of”:\n\nBen * (Arabic, Hebrew)\nDe * (Italian)\n*dze (Georgian)\n*escu (Romanian)\n*ian (Armenian, Persian)\n*ūnas (Lithuanian)\n*oğlu (Turkish)\n\nGiven the last example, you now know how Kinepolis got it right! :)\n\n\n\nName checker services\nThere exist services that bring name information to your fingertips. Namsor is such an example, try it out here - maybe even using R.\n\n\nHu, Y., Hu, C., Tran, T., Kasturi, T., Joseph, E., & Gillingham, M. (2021).

I took the time to explore the data a bit. It reminded me of this neat dashboard I drew some inspiration from.\nCompared to the US birthdays, the Belgian data is more granular and provides more opportunities to retrieve some insights in birth patterns. It is surprising how giving birth is less random than would one would initially assume.\nMost importantly, I observed:\n\nEffect of weekday: giving birth during weekend is far less common than giving birth on a weekday.\nEffect of seasons: people reproduce more frequently between October - December. As a consequence, more people are born between August - September.\n\nHave a look at the storyboard I created below. I start with how the time series data look like and explore some insights with more adequate visualizations.\n\nStoryboard\nAlso available here in full screen."

Some reasons below.\n\nAsymmetric encounter probabilities. For example, for Bayern, Club Brugge is 1 of the 4 potential opponents - whereas for Club Brugge, Bayern is 1 of the 7 potential opponents.\nDependence on previous draws. Each draw impacts subsequent event probabilities. If Club Brugge is drawn against a different team, Bayern only has 3 potential opponents left - which impacts probabilities.\nIt is possible that the sequence of draws results in the final draws violating the rules. Consider the scenario below, where the first 7 draws are:\n\n\n\nDraw\nTeam 1\nTeam 2\n\n\n\n\n1\nBenfica\nClub Brugge\n\n\n2\nNapoli\nFrankfurt\n\n\n3\nReal Madrid\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n\n4\nMan City\nLeipzig\n\n\n5\nTottenham\nMilan\n\n\n6\nPorto\nLiverpool\n\n\n7\nChelsea\nInter\n\n\n\nThe issue here is that the remaining teams are Bayern and Dortmund, which are both German teams and cannot play against each other. In other words, in this case the draw has to be restarted.\n\n\n\nMonte Carlo\nA straightforward solution for aforementioned complexities is estimating encounter probabilities using Monte Carlo integration. Simply put, we simulate the 16th round draw many times and count to what extent 1) violations and 2) team encounters occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me some code\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with mimicking a single draw.\nfunction(standing = tbl_standing) {\n\n    # make pots\n    pot1 &lt;- standing[standing$rnk == 1, ][[\"team\"]]\n    pot2 &lt;- standing[standing$rnk == 2, ][[\"team\"]]\n\n    # init 16round schedule df\n    schedule &lt;- data.frame(t1 = character(), t2 = character())\n\n    # repeat draw 8 times\n    for (drawing in 1:8) {\n        draw1 &lt;- sample(pot1, size = 1)\n        draw1_gr &lt;- standing[standing$team == draw1, ][[\"group\"]]\n        draw1_cn &lt;- standing[standing$team == draw1, ][[\"country\"]]\n\n        # rearrange to subset of pot 2\n        # 1) team in (updated) pot; 2) not of same country / group\n        pot2_subset &lt;- standing[\n            (\n                standing$team %in% pot2 &\n                    standing$country != draw1_cn &\n                    standing$group != draw1_gr\n            ),\n        ][[\"team\"]]\n\n        # draw 2nd team\n        # if pot2_subset is empty - this will throw an sample.int error\n        draw2 &lt;- sample(pot2_subset, size = 1)\n\n        pot1 &lt;- pot1[pot1 != draw1]\n        pot2 &lt;- pot2[pot2 != draw2]\n        schedule &lt;- rbind(schedule, data.frame(t1 = draw1, t2 = draw2))\n    }\n    schedule\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x135689488&gt;\nWhere tbl_standing looks like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrnk\nteam\ncountry\ngroup\n\n\n\n\n1\nBayern\nGER\nC\n\n\n1\nBenfica\nPOR\nH\n\n\n1\nChelsea\nENG\nE\n\n\n1\nMan City\nENG\nG\n\n\n1\nNapoli\nITA\nA\n\n\n1\nPorto\nPOR\nB\n\n\n1\nReal Madrid\nESP\nF\n\n\n1\nTottenham\nENG\nD\n\n\n2\nClub Brugge\nBEL\nB\n\n\n2\nDortmund\nGER\nG\n\n\n2\nFrankfurt\nGER\nD\n\n\n2\nInter\nITA\nC\n\n\n2\nLeipzig\nGER\nF\n\n\n2\nLiverpool\nENG\nA\n\n\n2\nMilan\nITA\nE\n\n\n2\nParis Saint-Germain\nFRA\nH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of a single draw of this function is then:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt1\nt2\n\n\n\n\nBayern\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n\nTottenham\nClub Brugge\n\n\nChelsea\nDortmund\n\n\nNapoli\nLeipzig\n\n\nMan City\nMilan\n\n\nReal Madrid\nFrankfurt\n\n\nBenfica\nInter\n\n\nPorto\nLiverpool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, Monte Carlo is about repeating the draw many times and calculating relative frequencies - accounting for potential errors due to the described problems.\n\nNERRORS &lt;- 0\nNSIM &lt;- 10000\niter &lt;- 1:NSIM\n\nresults &lt;- lapply(iter, function(i) {\n    tryCatch(\n        expr = draw_ko_phase(),\n        error = function(err) {\n            NERRORS &lt;&lt;- NERRORS + 1\n            return(NULL)\n        }\n    )\n})\n\nresults |&gt; \n    bind_rows() |&gt; \n    count(t1, t2) |&gt;\n    mutate(prob = n / (NSIM - NERRORS))\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, the probability of a restart of the draw is not to be underestimated! There is a 25.7% chance of having a draw that results in a scenario where the final teams in the pots are from the same group / country.\nFor the successful draws, estimations are presented in Table 1. The values indicate the probability of encountering the opponent. Chances are that the draw will result in a 16th round match between Bayern and Liverpool (37.7%). In the context of Monte Carlo this can be interpreted as\n\nFrom all the successful draws in the many repeats, 37.7% of the scenario’s had an encounter between Bayern and Liverpool.\n\n\n\nRecap\n\nUEFA’s restrictive rules can lead to imbalanced encounter probabilities.\nIn literature some corrections are described. See for example Robers & Rosenthal (2022).\nIn many complex situations Monte Carlo simulation is a very flexible method to obtain probabilities."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The notes below are guidelines I documented for myself in the future after consulting mainly this post and its comments suggesting improvements. This is especially useful if you want to set-up multiple work / personal git accounts on one device as smoothly as possible (i.e. no hassles regarding private repo authorisation, account-level git settings, account-level commit metadata etc.).\nLet’s go through an example.\n\n\nAim\nThe aim of a smooth git setup is twofold\n1) Authorization for private repos\nYou should be able to interact with private repos using the right authorization key. For example, if you want to clone a private personal or work repo, git should know what SSH to use.\n2) Configuration of git behavior\nGit should use the right configuration depending on the work / personal account. For example, if you are working on a work project, git should behave with different options related to merge strategy, commit metadata (email, username) etc.\n\n\nFolder setup\nTo select the correct authorization keys and configuration settings, work and personal projects should be organized into separate directories, as shown below\n/Users/sinan\n├── work\n│   ├── ml_project\n│   └── rag_app\n└─- personal\n    ├── learnings\n    └── ds_utils_pkg\n\n\nSSH keys and configuration\nCreate an SSH key for both accounts.\n\nNote that you could use a single key for multiple accounts, but this is not recommended as it complicates access management and key rotation.\n\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/work\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/personal\nNext, create an SSH config file that points to the correct SSH keys\n~/.ssh/config\nHost github.com-personal\n  HostName github.com\n  User sinanpl\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/personal\n\nHost github.com-work\n  HostName github.com\n  User sinan-work\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/work\nAt this point, you will be able to interact with private repos by using the work or personal host. Let’s say you have a private repo in your personal account you want to pull, you can use git clone git@github.com-personal:sinanpl/ds_utils_pkg.git. Similarly, you can use the github.com-work suffix for pulling private work repos. This is not ideal, but it can be improved in the following steps.\n\n\nAccount-level git config\nCreate separate .git.conf files for your work and personal account such that\n\nthe host can be altered from github.com-xxx to github.com\nthe account level settings can be configured such as:\n\nuser name\nuser email\nmerge strategy\ndefault branch name\n…\n\n\nIn the end, the files should look like:\n~/personal/.git.conf\n[url \"git@github.com-personal\"]\n  insteadOf = git@github.com\n\n[user]\n  email = sinan@mail.com\n~/work/.git.conf\n[url \"git@github.com-personal\"]\n  insteadOf = git@github.com\n\n[user]\n  email = sinan@work.com\n\n# example option\n# [pull]\n#   rebase = false\n\n\nGlobal git configuration\nFinally, you want to have a global configuration that dispatches to the correct configuration (and authorization) when working from a specific folder.\nCreate or update your global with the following\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/work/\"]\n    path = ~/work/.git.conf\n[includeIf \"gitdir:~/personal/\"]\n    path = ~/personal/.git.conf\n\n\nResult\n\nAuthorisation for work and personal accounts is separated\nCloning a private work repo from within your personal folder is not possible and vice versa.\nCloning private repos from the work or personal host no longer requires a suffix.\nGit behaves differently depending on account specification"
